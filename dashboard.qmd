#### Row {.tabset .flow}

::: {.card title="Deprivation"}

In many of the more rural areas on the outskirts of cities in the North of Pakistan, we observe high levels of deprivation combined with high levels of displacement - providing an initial indicator of areas in highest severity need

There is limited data availability of Facebook movements toward the south of Pakistan. Further analysis of these areas is recommended.

::: {.card title="Movement between places"}

This map shows volumes of travel between administrative areas, where volumes above baseline are coloured in Red and volumes below baseline are coloured in Blue. The width of the arrows is broadly representative of volumes. 

In the early days of the flooding events, we observe high levels of migration out of the Mirpur Khas area with the numbers of people entering this area below baseline.
