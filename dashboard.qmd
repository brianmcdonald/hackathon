## Source
This analysis is provided courtesy of Microsoft AI for Good Lab, using imagery from Planet SkySat from 2nd July 2024.

## Attribute details

-   damage_pct_0m – the fraction of the building footprint's area that is classified as damaged by the model

-   damage_pct_10m – total damaged area within a 10m buffer of the building footprint (including the footprint itself) / building footprint's area (this can be \>1.0 but we clip to 1.0)

-   damage_pct_20m – same as above but with a 20m buffer

-   damage – 1 if damage_pct_0m \> 0 else 0

-   unknown_pct– covered by clouds

## Limitations
This analysis uses optical satellite imagery and likely underestimates building damage as not all building damage can be detected from this visual perspective.
Cloud cover prevented analysis of 31% of the buildings.
