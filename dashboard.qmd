## Sources:
The displacement analysis is done using Facebook Popluation Estimates data from Meta's Data for Good initiative. Analysis was conducted by IOM.
The building damage asssment data is from Microsoft, using imagery from Planet.

## Limitations
Limitations of the displacement analysis include;

-   Levels and variance in Facebook usage by the affected populations.
-   Network infrastrctural issues can also impact the findings.

## Tab 1

{{< placeholder 400 200 format=svg >}}

All areas of Savanna-la-mer continue to see poulation estimates far below the pre-crisis baseline.

## Tab 2

{{< placeholder 400 200 format=svg >}}

Urban areas of Old Harbour show population estimates returning to close to pre-crisis levels, while the outskirts of the town, especially to the west, are still seeing a signficant decrease.

## Source
This analysis is provided courtesy of Microsoft AI for Good Lab, using imagery from Planet SkySat from 2nd July 2024.

## Attribute details

-   damage_pct_0m – the fraction of the building footprint's area that is classified as damaged by the model

-   damage_pct_10m – total damaged area within a 10m buffer of the building footprint (including the footprint itself) / building footprint's area (this can be \>1.0 but we clip to 1.0)

-   damage_pct_20m – same as above but with a 20m buffer

-   damage – 1 if damage_pct_0m \> 0 else 0

-   unknown_pct– covered by clouds

## Limitations
This analysis uses optical satellite imagery and likely underestimates building damage as not all building damage can be detected from this visual perspective.
Cloud cover prevented analysis of 31% of the buildings.
