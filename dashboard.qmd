#### Row {.tabset .flow}

::: {.card title="Deprivation"}

In many of the more rural areas on the outskirts of cities in the North of Pakistan, we observe high levels of deprivation combined with high levels of displacement - providing an initial indicator of areas in highest severity need

There is limited data availability of Facebook movements toward the south of Pakistan. Further analysis of these areas is recommended.

::: {.card title="Movement between places"}

This map shows volumes of travel between administrative areas, where volumes above baseline are coloured in Red and volumes below baseline are coloured in Blue. The width of the arrows is broadly representative of volumes. 

In the early days of the flooding events, we observe high levels of migration out of the Mirpur Khas area with the numbers of people entering this area below baseline.

Based on DTM's key informant's estimates, the top three priority needs identified among temporarily displaced persons (TDPs) are food (62%), reconstruction of shelters for those whose homes were completely destroyed (26%), and a range of other critical needs reported by 12% of respondents which includes needs drinking water and other reasons. The findings highlight that is a need for an immediate, coordinated action by humanitarian actors and relevant authorities to mobilize resources and deliver targeted support.

Access to safe and sufficient water has emerged as a critical challenge for flood-affected populations in Pakistanâ€™s Mirpur District. According to key informant data, nearly one-third of respondents (29%) reported that water is not available on the market, while 17% cited the long distances to water points as a major barrier. Additional challenges include lack of storage containers (14%), poor water quality - indicated by bad taste (10%), odour (5%), and visible contamination (4%) and safety concerns while fetching water (9%). 
 
These findings indicate a complex and urgent water crisis, where both availability and accessibility are compromised, putting affected communities at heightened risk of waterborne diseases and further displacement stress. Immediate multisectoral interventions are needed to restore functionality of water points, provide safe drinking water, and ensure equitable access, particularly for women and children who are often most affected by water collection burdens.
